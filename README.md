# Sudoku-Puzzle
Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle played on a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. The goal is to fill the grid so that each row, column, and subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. Players must use deduction and reasoning to solve it, as the puzzle starts with some cells prefilled with numbers.
